<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi there, I am a new web developer who's just starting to leave his mark on the humungous habitat we call the internet. <br />
  I take orders for any and all businesses to make them a website at affordable prices and the added security of money back gurantee if it's not up to your Standards. <br />
  My past projects I have worked on are available on the home page, which you can also access by clicking <a href="../index.html">here</a>.
</p>
<p>Now, about me:</p>
<p>
  I am a computer Science graduate from Mumbai University. <br />
  Majority of my life has been spent in this bustling city where light and dreams burn the brightest and I plan to shine the most. <br />
  I am still learning and figuring out how I can make my own unique impact but for now I will continue doing what I am doing and hope for the best.
