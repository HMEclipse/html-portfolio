    <h1>The best movies according to Himanshu</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
    <p>
      This is quite possibly the movie that had the most impact on me while growing up. <br />
      My love for any kind of fantasy or it's sub-genres can be traced back to very movie.
    </p>
    <h3>Dune</h3>
    <p>
      A rather recent movie but the visuals, story and music has left a lasting impact on me. <br />
      One of the best sci-fi movies of recent time, that once again spark anew my love for the genre.
    </p>
    <h3>La La Land</h3>
    <p>
      The movie that probably hurt me the most of all the romance movies I have seen. <br />
      It was just so good in direction, the way their love evolved and the unfortuante turn of events that sepereated them.
